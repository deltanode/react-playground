## `Chapter-10 What is seen is sold`

- Why frameworks? 
  - optimized css, 
  - consistent UI
  - saves time.
  - Eg : MaterialUI, Bootstrap, Base Web UI, Ant design, chakra UI

- Can we use more than one framework ? 
  - It's all package can use any number of frameworks, 
  - But, not consistent way

- Different ways to write css :
  1. Native CSS - all components's styles in a single file index.css
  2. SCSS - Syntactical CSS - atlast it is converted to css
  3. Inline - style attribute - pass object - {{backgroundColor : "red"}}
  4. Component Library - MaterialUI, Bootstrap, Base Web UI, Ant design, chakra UI
  5. CSS Framework - Tailwind
  6. styled-components

- Pros :
  - consistent UI
  - save time

- Cons :
  - Bundle size -
  - Loose control over design
  - personal customizition is hard

### Tailwind CSS:

- css on the go (in the same file )
- reusablity
- less bundle size (minimal css) only includes the css classes that we have used
- Flexible UI (Customize)
